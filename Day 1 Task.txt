Machine Learning:

	Machine Learning is a very famous term which is used in nearly every other sector, from IT to business. 
It can be defined as "A piece of software which develops itself from a given dataset".Here the dataset is the sample or information related to the project user is working on. 
A machine learning system consists of complex algorithms which analyzes the given dataset and gives output based on its accuracy.
	The ML systems are not explictly coded to obtain a specific output but rather coded in such a way that they learn fromtheir environment i.e dataset. Some of the examples of such systems are Amazon's Alexa,Netflix's Suggestions, Amazon's Suggestions,
Google and Youtube's Recommendations,etc. They have affected not only the software industry but also the digital markets.
	Machine Learning is broadly classified into 3 types based on the technique of learning as:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning:

	Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.
It helps you to optimize performance criteria using experience.
Supervised machine learning helps you to solve various types of real-world computation problems.

Unsupervised Learning:

	Unsupervised machine learning finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
Unsupervised methods help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of learners.
It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual intervention.
